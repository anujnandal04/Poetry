                                As the doors were about to shut, sealing us in, she leaned back against the wall, eyes locked onto mine - challenging, waiting. I stepped closer to seize the moment. I grabbed her wrists, pinning her against the wall. One hand slid behind her back, gripping her cushiony body like a piece of soft meat about to be devoured, the other still holding her left wrist.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                I could feel her body heat rising rapidly against the cold walls of the lift. My eyes stayed on hers, but hers were fixed on my lips. I released her wrist and ran my fingers through her hair, tossing away her scrunchie. Her hair now cascaded freely. As I eased in to kiss her, I felt her hands press down on my shoulders.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Our lips met - hers brushed against mine, cold from the winter evening. It felt like inhaling a deep breath on a foggy morning, cold and utterly refreshing. I didn't want to let go.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                We drew even closer, her breath growing heavier - warmer, more intense. Yet neither of us showed mercy. We were ready to tear each other apart. Now, I could taste her saliva - a mix of sweet and tangy, like a lemon candy. With each passing moment and the lift ascending higher, everything seemed to grow more intense - our breathing merging, hearts pounding harder, fingers tangled tightly in each other's hair, like a Harley tearing down an open highway at full throttle, tension thick in the air.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Each kiss grew hungrier, rougher, as if the world outside the lift no longer existed. Bodies pressed closer, heat rising between us like a storm refusing to settle. When the lift finally stopped and the bell rang 18 times, I grabbed this little jellyfish by her thighs, lifting her up - her hands clinging tightly to my shoulders.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Stepping back, I pressed 10th with my elbow, and as the doors shut once more, we dove right back into our reckoning, lost in the feverish pull of the moment. By the time we reached the 10th floor, neither of us wanted to stop. Still lost in the heat, unbothered by anything else, I tried carrying her outside, our lips still tangled, like something being pulled toward the center of a black hole.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                As I stepped back, my foot got stuck, and we both fell to the floor just outside the lift. Now, I lay on the ground, and this little mass of chaos was above me, watching me - ready to go reckoning the very next moment. And she did. I could feel her weight growing on my chest, yet she didn't seem to go easy. We kissed again. This time, I could feel how breathless she'd grown. I too joined in.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                I could feel the tense movements of her little tongue inside my mouth, as if waves of a tsunami hitting hard on a calm shore, crashing against the hard rocks, ready to ruin everything in its path. Lying on the ground, she was on top of me, and we kept kissing, neither of us wanting to stop.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Our hearts now in complete sync, her hair loose - falling on my face, the smell of her perfume and sweat combined into one, something so sweet and warm, her saliva pouring down like a waterfall into my mouth. The world, never felt so good. In that stillness, with her breath on my skin and the echo of our kisses fading, I held onto her like a chipped teacup - fragile, but mine.

                                It was a late evening. Not the kind with dramatic sunsets or poetic rain — just quiet. The sky was soft, like a faded bedsheet. Luca sat across from her on the floor, both backs resting against the wall. No music played. Just the fan spinning above and the leftover warmth of tea cups between them.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                He looked at her — not in that dreamy-eyed way they show in movies — but the kind of look where someone's trying to remember every small detail, just in case.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                "I know I say dumb things sometimes," he began, fiddling with the spoon. "Like mentioning some imaginary girl, or that school crush I never even spoke to." Elara raised an eyebrow, "Hmm?"
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                He smiled a little. "It's just a trick. So I don't get too attached to you… you know, in case we don't make it through someday. It might hurt less that way."
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                She didn't say anything for a moment. Just breathed. Then, softly: "Don't worry. I won't let you go."
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Luca didn't reply. He leaned in, kissed her forehead gently, and whispered, "It's an honor to serve you, Doc." A minute passed. Or maybe an hour — Luca was never good with time around her.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Then he asked, almost childishly, "If you're to disappear one day… how am I supposed to find you?"
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Elara looked at him — eyes soft, like she'd already rehearsed this in her mind. "Find me by listening to my favorite songs," she said, "and watching my favorite flowers bloom… in the garden of Lisbon."
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                He nodded, smiled, and with a small wink, replied, "Sure. I'll bring your favorite flowers." That was all. They didn't make big promises. No confessions screamed at midnight. Just a quiet agreement — one that stayed with him.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Even now, years later, on certain days, Luca plays her playlist on loop. And someday — maybe not today, maybe not soon — he'll book a flight to Lisbon.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                And wait. In her garden.

                                It wasn't supposed to be a fight. Just another day, just another talk.

                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Elara was already dealing with her colleague that day; someone she didn't want to talk to but had to. She was already tired of justifying things she didn't owe anyone. But Luca, he didn't know that. Not fully. Maybe he didn't ask enough.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                That evening, Elara texted Luca something she thought was harmless. She told him she blocked the guy. She explained herself, maybe more than needed.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                "He might think I needed something from him, that's why I blocked him."

                                "So what."

                            <p class="paragraph">
                                That's what came back.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                "When did you start giving a fuck about strangers you met two days ago?"

                            <p class="paragraph">
                                It hit. Not just the words, but how cold it sounded. She tried to keep it simple. But Luca's reply cut through:
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                "Don't talk to me. I hate you even more."<br>
                                "You're no different."<br>
                                "And don't even try to call or message me."
                            </p>

                                London was always loud, always moving. People rushing past like they were late for something important. But on this one corner, under the soft glow of an old streetlamp, a guy sat with his guitar. Nothing fancy—just old wood and strings that had clearly seen better days. He wasn't anyone big. No crowds, no stage. Just him, the pavement, and whoever felt like slowing down for a minute.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Most didn't.

                            <p class="paragraph">
                                But the ones who did? They stayed longer than they meant to. His music wasn't loud or flashy; it was quiet, honest. The kind that made you feel like it was just for you, even if you'd never hear it again.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                One time, a businessman stopped. Loosened his tie, stood there listening as something soft played. Didn't know the song, but it brought something back. Maybe a memory, maybe a feeling. He dropped a coin in the case and walked off a bit lighter.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Later, a couple showed up. Holding hands, whispering. The music felt like it fit them. Like it was part of their story. Before they left, the girl gave the guitarist a smile. He nodded. Nothing big—just a quiet little moment shared.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                By night, the street emptied. Got colder. But he stayed a bit longer, playing for no one in particular. Just him and the echo of his guitar bouncing off old brick walls.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                When it was time, he packed up. Hat had a few coins. Not a lot, but enough. He smiled. Sometimes that's all you need - a quiet corner, a wooden guitar, and a few people who stop long enough to listen.

                                It was the gala evening. Luca had stepped out before the show began. He usually did that for some fresh air, to calm his mind. It helped him control the piano keys better.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                "I clearly remember—it was her," Luca began writing.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                She stood by the cliff, maybe breathing in the evening quiet the same way he was. Not many were around. He had gone out with the intention to talk. But when she suddenly turned around with that same quiet energy, he walked past her and stood a little farther off, by the cliff.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                As usual, he began wondering what might be going on in her mind. She was looking at the sea.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                <em>You stand where the ocean meets the sky, as if nature pauses to listen to your silence. She looked at the ocean like it owed her answers and maybe it did.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                <em>There was something about the way she stood there, like someone who had already drowned once—not in water, but in something that once called itself love.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                <em>She seemed like the pages of a diary, those that had been burned so beautifully, and what remained were not ashes, but fragments, still fragrant.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Suddenly, she came closer.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                <strong>Her:</strong> So, what's up?<br>
                                <strong>Me:</strong> In what context is that supposed to be?
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                <strong>Her:</strong> You came closer... and then stepped away.<br>
                                <strong>Me:</strong> Just a habit.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                <strong>Her:</strong> Be brave. Writer?<br>
                                <strong>Me:</strong> Overthinker.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                <strong>Her:</strong> Hmm. Wondering what's going on in that beautiful brain?<br>
                                <strong>Me:</strong> My brain isn't beautiful. It's peace and chaos in co-existence.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                <strong>Her:</strong> That's what makes it even more beautiful.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                And we talked. After a few minutes, we walked in for the evening. I had found an unexpected companion for a night that already felt a little too quiet.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                <em>She walked beside me, not trying too hard, not needing to. It felt easy — like we'd met before in another life, where things were slower and hearts spoke first.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                I never asked her name. Didn't want to break the moment. So I called her Sel — the only name that came to mind. Maybe because she reminded me of the moon. Still, soft, and just... there.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                After the party, I looked for her in the crowd. Never found her again. And maybe I wasn't meant to. Maybe she was the kind of moment you only get once, but think about for years.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Sometimes, all you need for an evening is a patient listener.

                                I've been holding up the weight of relationships, like dragging corpses of my dead dreams, smiling through every obligation, bleeding behind every "I'm fine."
