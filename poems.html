                                Pull it closer—close enough to feel its warmth on this chilly winter morning.<br>
                                Think of it as me, hugging you, hands wrapped around your waist.

                                She tilted her head slightly, and before I could think or speak,<br>
                                her lips found mine - hesitant at first, almost like a question.<br>
                                I answered without words, pulling her closer,<br>
                                feeling her heartbeat race against my own.

                                I wake before the world stirs.<br>
                                I reach for my phone,<br>

                                a habit I never unlearned.<br>
                                I tell myself I don't check your texts anymore.<br>
                                But sometimes, when sleep refuses to come, I do.

                                Sometimes I catch you online.<br>
                                Maybe you're studying, chasing your dreams as you always did.<br>
                                Maybe you're singing softly to yourself.<br>
                                Maybe you're just scrolling, numbing yourself to the world.<br>
                                Or maybe, like me, you're just breathing in this delicate summer morning.

                                I dream of the fragrance of your perfume,<br>
                                even though I know it could never quite match the essence of your body.

                                I can see myself carrying a corpse of something unknown.<br>
                                It has the same body complexion as mine, the same weight and height—<br>
                                only, I'm unable to see its face.<br>
                                Yet, I do not feel its weight on my shoulder; it all feels insubstantial.

                                Even typing "you" feels softer than any other word on my notepad.

                                He saw her today, after so many days of just watching her from a distance. Their paths finally crossed, close enough to feel her presence, yet still separated by unspoken words. He didn't expect it, but there she was—like a moment he had only dreamed of.
                            </p>

                                Her face looked just as beautiful as he remembered, with some small changes—a new hairstyle or a deeper look in her eyes. She seemed a little different, but it only made her more interesting. She had a new sense of confidence that made him like her even more.
                            </p>
                            <p class="stanza">
                                As he stood there, all the times he had admired her from afar came rushing back—the stolen glances, the imagined conversations, the countless what-ifs. He noticed how she had changed, how the girl he once liked had grown into someone even more amazing.
                            </p>
                            <p class="stanza">
                                And then it hit him—this might be the last time he'd see her like this, so close yet so far. The thought stung, knowing that his quiet admiration would stay just that—unspoken and unfinished, a part of his life that would end without ever really starting.
